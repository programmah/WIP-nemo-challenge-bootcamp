# NeMo-Challenge-Bootcamp

The NeMo Challenge Bootcamp is designed from a real-world perspective, following the data processing, development, and deployment pipeline paradigm. Attendees walk through the workflow of preprocessing a multi-turn conversational dataset for the summarization task and fine-tune the dataset on SOTA LLM using NeMo-Run. Attendees will also learn to optimize the fine-tuned model and apply prompt engineering techniques to solve complex real-world tasks. Furthermore, we introduced an AI Assistant customer care use case challenge to test attendees' understanding of the material and solidify their experience in the Text Generation domain.

## Bootcamp Content

This content contains three labs, plus a challenge notebook:
