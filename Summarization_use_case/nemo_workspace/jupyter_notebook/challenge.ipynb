    "### Challenge Title: AI-Powered Chat Summarization for Customer Care Efficiency \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "In today's digital landscape, customer support teams handle an ever-increasing volume of interactions across multiple platforms, including chat, email, and social media. These interactions often involve repetitive queries, lengthy exchanges, and important customer context that need to be efficiently understood and addressed. Manual handling of these conversations daily leads to:\n",
    "- Time wasted: manually reading long chat histories to understand customer issues.  \n",
    "- Inconsistent service and human error: This is due to agents missing key details in lengthy chats.  \n",
    "- Slow response times, especially when chats are transferred between agents.\n",
    "- Difficulty in post-chat analysis: for training and compliance.\n",
    "     \n",
    "One solution to this is to automate chat summarization, thereby streamlining customer care workflows. Summarizing long and multi-turn conversations into concise, coherent, and actionable insights allows customer support agents and quality analysts to focus on resolution rather than review. However, traditional summarization tools struggle with the dynamic nature and complexity of customer support dialogues, as well as the domain-specific terminology associated with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Task Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective of this project is to develop an AI-driven chat summarization system using the NVIDIA NeMo framework to:\n",
    "- Automatically generate concise summaries of customer chats in real time.\n",
    "- In your summaries, highlight the key intents, issues, and resolutions to facilitate faster agent response.\n",
    "- Automated tagging for analytics (e.g., common complaints, sentiment) should also be enabled. \n"

    "### Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary dataset for the challenge is `TweetSumm.`  TWEETSUMM comprises 1100 dialogs reconstructed from Tweets that appear in the Kaggle Customer Support On Twitter dataset2, each accompanied by three extractive and three abstractive summaries generated by human annotators. The dataset is based on conversations between consumers and customer support agents on Twitter.com. It covers a wide range of topics and services provided by various companies, including airlines, retail, gaming, music, etc. TweetSum consists of train, test, and validation sets. For further details, please visit [https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11894](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11894) to read the technical paper. There are two ways to access the dataset:\n",
    "- **GitHub**:  You can download the dataset by cloning the repo [https://github.com/guyfe/Tweetsumm/tree/main](https://github.com/guyfe/Tweetsumm/tree/main)\n",
    "- **HuggingFace**: The dataset is gated on `Huggingface` and requires an HF token to access or download it. Click on the [User Access Token link](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/security-tokens) to see the steps for generating the HF security token. TweetSum can be found in the dialogue summarization dataset from the Salesforce DialogStudio.  \n",
